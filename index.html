  <h1 class="main-title">A Letter to the Man Who Came Back Home to Me</h1>

  <div class="letter">
    <p>To the one I found, lost, and found again — <strong>Happy 25th Birthday, my love.</strong></p>

    <p>I still remember the day we connected <strong>(July 22, 2019)</strong> on Neargroup. We were both broken and just starting to heal from past relationships. It’s funny how life brings people together when they least expect it — like what happened to us. I never imagined that a simple conversation would turn into something so meaningful.</p>

    <p>Six days later, <strong>July 28, 2019</strong>, we took a chance on each other to be official in our relationship. And even though we were just beginning, it already felt like home. Every time I'm with you, I found comfort, honesty, and a space where I could truly be myself. We laughed, we dreamed, we argued, we stumbled — but we were real. Everything felt almost perfect… until it wasn’t.</p>

    <p>On <strong>March 14, 2020</strong>, you broke up with me. I was left carrying a kind of pain I had experienced before. You weren’t just a boyfriend to me — you were someone I pictured my future with. So losing you shattered that picture.</p>

    <p>Months passed. I entered a new relationship in <strong>December 2020</strong>, but deep down, something was missing. And maybe that’s why it didn’t work out — because the space you left in my heart was never meant for anyone else.</p>

    <p>Then, like fate trying again, <strong>November 2022</strong> came. We reconnected on Facebook, and on <strong>December 12, 2022</strong>, we chose to continue what we once had — not where we left off, but stronger, older, and hopefully wiser.</p>

    <p>It hasn’t been easy since. Life isn’t as light as it used to be. We now face grown-up problems, dreams, pressures, and responsibilities. There were moments when we thought of letting go again… but we didn’t. We held on. And that’s what love is, right? Not perfect, not always easy — but always worth fighting for.</p>

    <p>I love you so much. And I know you love me too. I see it in your efforts, your patience, your strength. I appreciate your hard work more than I say. I’m proud of the man you are becoming. And when the time comes for my own breakthroughs — for the opportunities I’ve been praying for — I want only three people beside me: my family, friends, and you.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being my person, even when it was complicated. Thank you for staying, even when it got hard. And thank you… for being born.</p>

    <p><strong>Happy 25th Birthday, love.</strong> I pray this year brings you peace, growth, and blessings in ways you never expected. We’re still writing our story — and I still believe in our happy ending.</p>

      This is my first favorite photo because on this day (<strong>December 31, 2022</strong>) we traveled to Tanay to celebrate New Year 2023 with my family. It was also the day you reunited with them after a very long time.<br><br>
      Cheers to more New Years with you, my love.
