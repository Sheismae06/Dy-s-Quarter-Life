        <p>To the one I found, lost, and found again ‚Äî Happy 25th Birthday, my love.</p>
        <p>I still remember the day we connected (July 22, 2019) on Neargroup. We were both broken and just starting to heal from past relationships. It‚Äôs funny how life brings people together when they least expect it like what happened to us. I never imagined that a simple conversation would turn into something so meaningful.</p>
        <p>Six days later, July 28, 2019 we took a chance on each other to be official in our relationship. Even though we were just beginning, it already felt like home. Every time I'm with you, I found comfort, honesty, and a space where I could truly be myself. We laughed, we dreamed, we argued, we stumbled‚Äîbut we were real. Everything felt almost perfect‚Ä¶ until it wasn‚Äôt.</p>
        <p>March 14, 2020, you broke up with me. I was left carrying a kind of pain I experienced before. You weren‚Äôt just a boyfriend to me because you were someone I pictured my future with and losing you shattered that picture.</p>
        <p>Months passed. I was in a new relationship in December 2020, but deep down, something was missing. And maybe that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt work out for me. Because the space you left in my heart was never meant for anyone else.</p>
        <p>Then, like fate trying again, November 2022 came. We reconnected on Facebook and on December 12, 2022, we chose to continue what we once had. Not where we left off, but stronger, older, and hopefully wiser.</p>
        <p>It hasn‚Äôt been easy since. Life isn‚Äôt as light as it used to be. We now face grown-up problems and dreams, pressures, responsibilities. There were moments when we thought of letting go again‚Ä¶ but we didn‚Äôt. We held on. And that‚Äôs what love is, right? Not perfect, not always easy, but always worth fighting for.</p>
        <p>I love you so much. And I know you love me too. I see it in your efforts, your patience, your strength. I appreciate your hard work more than I say. I‚Äôm proud of the man you are becoming. And when the time comes for my own breakthroughs, for the opportunities I‚Äôve been praying for, I want only three people beside me: my family, friends and you.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being my person, even when it was complicated. Thank you for staying, even when it got hard. And thank you‚Ä¶ for being born.</p>
        <p>Happy 25th Birthday, love. I pray this year brings you peace, growth, and blessings in ways you never expected. We‚Äôre still writing our story‚Äîand I still believe in our happy ending.</p>

          This is my first favorite photo because on this day (December 31, 2022) we traveled to Tanay to celebrate New Year 2023 with my family. It was also the day you reunited with them after a very long time. Cheers to more New Years with you, my love.
