    <p class="intro fade-in">To the one I found, lost, and found again — Happy 25th Birthday, my love.</p>

    <section class="letter fade-in">
      <p>I still remember the day we connected (July 22, 2019) on Neargroup. We were both broken then, just starting to heal from past relationships. It’s funny how life brings people together when they least expect it like what happened to us. I never imagined that a simple conversation would turn into something so meaningful and special.</p>

      <p>Six days later, July 28, 2019 we took a chance on each other to be official in our relationship. Even though we were just beginning, it already felt like home. With you, I found comfort, honesty, and a space where I could truly be myself. We laughed, we dreamed, we argued, we stumbled—but we were real. Everything felt almost perfect… until it wasn’t.</p>

      <p>March 14, 2020, you break up with me. I was left carrying a kind of pain I experienced before. You weren’t just a boyfriend to me because for me you were someone I pictured my future with and losing you shattered that picture.</p>

      <p>Months passed. Were in a new relationship on December 2020, but deep down, something was missing. And maybe that’s why it didn’t work out with them. Because the space we left in our heart was never meant for anyone else.</p>

      <p>Then, like fate trying again, November 2022 came. We reconnected. And on December 12, 2022, we chose to continue what we once had. Not where we left off, but stronger, older, and hopefully wiser.</p>

      <p>It hasn’t been easy since. Life isn’t as light as it used to be. We now face grown up problems and dreams, pressures, responsibilities. There were moments when we thought of letting go again… but we didn’t. We held on. And that’s what love is, right? Not perfect, not always easy but always worth fighting for.</p>

      <p>I love you so much. And I know you love me too. I see it in your efforts, your patience, your strength. I appreciate your hard work more than I say. I’m proud of the man you are becoming. And when the time comes for my own breakthroughs for the opportunities I’ve been praying for, I want only three  people beside me: my family, Joecelle and you.</p>

      <p>Thank you for being my person, even when it was complicated. Thank you for staying, even when it got hard. And thank you… for being born.</p>

      <p>Happy 25th Birthday, love. I pray this year brings you peace, growth, and blessings in ways you never expected. We’re still writing our story and I still believe in our happy ending.</p>

      <p class="signoff">With all my love,<br>Angela Mae Maco</p>
