    <!-- Your exact updated letter content here -->
    <p>He enjoys playing basketball and mobile games, listening to music, reading manga, and watching anime, Asian dramas, and action-packed movies or series.</p>
    <p>He doesn’t like seeing the ones he loves being disrespected. He’s very protective of his family and loved ones. He also gets upset when someone lies in front of him, especially when he already knows the truth.</p>
    <p>He’s a hardworking man. When he’s upset, he tends to be quiet — but just one act of affection is usually enough to make him feel better. Of course, he’s not perfect. He makes mistakes too and can be impatient sometimes. But what matters is that he learns from them and continues to grow.</p>
    <p>I’m grateful for the man who came back — stronger, better, and still mine.</p>
