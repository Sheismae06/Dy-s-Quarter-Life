      <p>Jeremy Marcial was born on July 20, 2000. He’s a Cancer, born in the Year of the Dragon, and grew up in Quezon City. He enjoys the simple things—playing basketball and mobile games, listening to music, reading manga, and watching anime, Asian dramas, and action-packed movies or series.</p>
      <p>His favorite color is green. When it comes to food, he’s not that picky as long as it tastes good. But don’t expect him to eat sardines, bagoong, tuyo, itlog na maalat, or daing. If the ulam is fish, fried tilapia is always the safest bet for him.</p>
      <p>He’s a fan of BTS and loves anime with lots of action. One of his dreams is to travel to Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. He just wants to go places, find peace, be happy, and be financially stable.</p>
      <p>At first, he may seem quiet and distant, but once you get to know him, you’ll see that he’s kind, loyal, and real. He’s very protective of the people he loves and values honesty. He works hard, and when he’s upset, he stays quiet but one sweet gesture can already make him feel better. He’s not perfect, but he learns, grows, and knows how to say sorry.</p>
